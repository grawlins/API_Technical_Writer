I am an API technical writer at Intuit, where I am responsible for documenting the QuickBooks Online SDKs, available for .NET, Java, and PHP. Some of the previous companies I have worked for as an API technical writer include Autodesk, Sony Playstation Network, ServiceNow, Trend Micro, and Microsoft.
